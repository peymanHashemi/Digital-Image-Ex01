# Question 1
Is beauty measurable?
In this exercise we have some pictures of famouse soccer players (Dataset1). We try to measure beauty with PSNR and SSIM metric.
At first we create a mirror of every image and we split original and mirrored image and we combine them in ‘L ⅃’, ‘Я R’, and ‘Я ⅃’ order.
At last compute PSNR and SSIM metrics for every combined picture.

Result :

# Question 2
The Art of Hiding Messages in Pixels
We are given two seemingly random grayscale images which contain a secret message. 
The idea is to move one image on another and find the hidden message using basic image operations.

Result :

# Question 3
Analyzing Some Global Warming Impacts
We are given 4 set of datasets.

A) We should find the approximate volume of water evaporated between 2 images.

B) We should find the approximate volume of water evaporated.

C) what proportion of the glacier has been melted over the given time interval?

D) We should plot a bar graph representing the approximate volume of the lake in each five years separately.


Result (C):

# Question 4
 Creating A Pac-Man Demo
 
In this problem, the goal is to create a demo version of Pac-Man, 
which, in spite of being non-playable, follows the rules of the game.
You are given an image of the maze at its initial point as well as different elements of the game in various states.
